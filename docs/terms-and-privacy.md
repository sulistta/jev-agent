# Terms of Use & Privacy

**Last updated:** March 2026

"We" in this document refers to the maintainers of the open-source Page Agent project (https://github.com/alibaba/page-agent). "The software" refers to Page Agent (the JavaScript library) and Page Agent Ext (the browser extension). This document covers the software itself — **not** any third-party product or service configured by a user.

---

## 1. Open Source Software Privacy

The software is a **client-side only** tool with a "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) architecture. The software itself does **not** include any backend service. The software does **not** collect or transmit any user data on its own, and we do **not** have access to your browsing activity, page content, or task instructions through the software.

All data transmission occurs **only** between your browser and the LLM provider you configure. You are in full control of which provider receives your data.

The project is open source under the [MIT License](https://github.com/alibaba/page-agent/blob/main/LICENSE) and can be audited at: https://github.com/alibaba/page-agent

---

## 2. Browser Extension (Page Agent Ext)

### Data Processing

The extension performs DOM analysis and automation actions **locally in your browser**. Your browsing history, passwords, and form data are not accessed or collected by the extension developer.

Data is transmitted to external servers **only when you initiate an automation task**. When this occurs:

- Your task instructions (natural language commands)
- Simplified page structure (cleaned HTML) of all pages under the extension's control

are sent to the LLM API endpoint configured in **your settings**.

> **Note:** The HTML cleaning process simplifies page structure for AI readability but **does not guarantee removal of sensitive information** (e.g., visible text, form values, or personal data on the page). Please be mindful of the page content when initiating tasks.

**If you configure a third-party LLM provider** (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, or others), data is sent directly to that provider. Their privacy policies apply.

### Data Storage

- **Local storage only**: Your configuration (API endpoint, API key, model selection) is stored in your browser via `chrome.storage.local` (or equivalent browser storage APIs)
- **No cloud sync**: Configuration is not synced to any external server
- **No analytics**: The extension does not include any analytics or tracking code

### Your Control

- The extension is open source and can be audited by anyone
- You choose which LLM provider to use
- You may configure your own API endpoint at any time
- You can clear all stored data by removing the extension
